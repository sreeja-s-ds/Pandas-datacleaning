# Pandas-datacleaning
In this project, I performed data cleaning on Chennai building sales data using Pandas. 
I began by loading the dataset. I standardized column names and data types for consistency and converted date fields into proper datetime formats.  Duplicates were removed to maintain data integrity. 
I also corrected inconsistent Spelling entries and then encoded the Columns which were in Object Dtype .
Also, I Calculated the Building age. The cleaned dataset is now structured, reliable, and ready for further analysis, ensuring accurate insights during the exploration and modeling stages of the project.
